# About Me:
Hey, I‚Äôm Laween! I used to work as a civil engineer, but now I‚Äôm studying computer science at Minnesota State University Moorhead (MSUM). I'm building up my skills in software development, game design, and all things tech. I create things that are useful or fun, but rarely both.

## What I Do
- **Programming:** I mainly use Python and C#, and I love building games and tools in Unity. I enjoy the challenge of bringing ideas to life through code.
- **Design:** I also work on digital design: logos, branding, and layout work using Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. Clean design matters to me.


## Featured Projects:
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

### **Collaborative Chess Voting System (CCVS)**

A CLI-based platform that lets teams play chess together by voting on moves. Built to support asynchronous, team-based play in academic settings.

### **TinyNetUse-Taskbar**

A lightweight Windows app that displays real-time network usage directly in the taskbar.

### **Voice-Command-Assistant**

A local voice assistant powered by a local LLM that can do all the basic stuff a regular voice assistant can do and has the power of any LLM model of your choosing to take care of the more complex stuff.

### **Dark Souls 3 Reinforcement Learning AI**
 
An experimental AI agent trained to play Dark Souls 3 using reinforcement learning.

### **ReqWatcher**
 
Automatically track and record your pip install commands in real-time.
